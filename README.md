Sandi SM-1200

This App was optimized for iOS. It might also run on Android, but we did not test it. 

To install the App, follow these steps:

1. Download Flutter and XCode
if you run 'flutter doctor' in your terminal, you should see checkmarks at 
=> Flutter
=> XCode
=> Connected Device
=> HTTP Host Availability

2. Clone the GitHub-Repository

3. Open the Flutter-Project
run 'flutter clean' in the Terminal of the Project
run 'flutter pub get' to install all the packages that are needed

4. Open Runner.xcworkspace in XCode
you can find Runner.xcworkspace in the ios-folder of the Project

5. Setup Device
In XCode select the device (iPhone or iPad or Simulator), you want to run the App on. You can find the options for that
at the top center of the XCode window.
Select, if you want to run the App in Release Mode or Debug Mode. Click therefor on Runner (left to where you set your device), then 
on Edit Scheme, then select your Build Configurations. Note that Release Mode will probably only work on real devices. 

6. Run
